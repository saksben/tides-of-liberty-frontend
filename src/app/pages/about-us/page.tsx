      <p>
        When in the course of human events it becomes evident that people in
        general choose to believe policies without thinking about its
        philosophy, to vote for someone or something only because it was one of
        the two options given or what their team told them to vote for, and to
        yield their autonomy to the powerful in an exchange of liberty for
        safety, then it is up to those who care about liberty to transform the
        population.

        The Declaration of Independence. The Constitution of the United States.
        The messages of the classical thinkers of the Enlightenment. These are
        our symbols of liberty. These are what we may study to learn how we can
        bring about a land of liberty.

        When England tried to have a monopoly on violence over the American
        colonies, Benjamin Franklin spread an image of a snake cut into 13
        pieces, each representing an American colony. The caption below:
        &#34;Join or Die.&#34; Franklin knew that this artistic display of wit
        was the catalyst of inspiring revolution.

        To strike against authority is not the way to win back our liberty; in
        doing so, that only allows for the powerful to wave us off by labeling
        us as rebels and terrorists. The way we take back our liberty is to
        change peoples&#39; minds, and the most effective way to do so is to
        whisper a subtle message into their ear. This message turns into a
        peaceful discussion, and that discussion turns into the{" "}
        <em>voluntary</em> establishment of philosophy, which in turn influences
        decisions. In a world where the state has a monopoly on violence, this
        may be the only way to effectively have our revolution.{" "}

        The key to starting a revolution is not through the first actor. It is
        through the first follower. For the first follower is the one who shows
        everyone else that we can stand together behind a cause. It is because
        of the first follower that the second, third, fourth, and hundredth
        follower join.

        Tides of Liberty is a liberty- and libertarian-themed store. We provide
        shirts, hoodies, mugs, hats, and more with the vision of having an army
        of individuals who show the world that we can change our nations without
        even lifting a finger against anyone else. Our highest ideals are life,
        liberty, property, the pursuit of happiness, and individualism. The
        revolution of nations starts with the revolution of minds. Will you join
        the revolution?
