        We want to make sure that you are 100% satisfied through the entire
        process, which is why we offer returns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any claims for misprinted/damaged/defective items must be submitted
        within 72 hours after the product has been received. For packages lost
        in transit, all claims must be submitted no later than 4 weeks after the
        estimated delivery date. Claims deemed an error on our part are covered
        at our expense.

        Please give us an email at customerservice@tidesofliberty.com with as
        much detail about the situation as possible, and if it is an error,
        please email a picture of that error.

      <p>
        To be eligible for a return, your item must be unused, unwashed, and in
        the same condition that you received it.
      </p>

      <p>
        If return is due to a misprinted/damaged/defective item, DO NOT WEAR,
        USE, OR WASH THE PRODUCT, or we will not be able to accept the return.
        Please send the unworn and unwashed product to the return address
        included on the packing list sent, or email
        customerservice@tidesofliberty.com.
      </p>

      <p>To complete your return, we require a receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

      <p>
        If you are approved, then your refund will be processed once we have
        received your order, and a credit will automatically be applied to your
        credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of
        days.
      </p>

      <p>Late or missing refunds (if applicable):</p>

      <p>
        If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your
        refund is officially posted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a
        refund is posted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund
        yet, please contact us at customerservice@tidesofliberty.com.
