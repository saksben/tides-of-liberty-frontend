        We are constantly looking for ways for our store to be able to get
        orders made and shipped to your door as fast as possible, while
        providing a lot of value.
        <br />
        <br />
        Due to demand, there may be a delay in production and shipping times,
        but typically a US order will be processed and arrive at the customer&#39;s
        door within 7-14 business days from when the order is processed (7-30 if
        international), barring any shipping delays or holidays. You will be
        getting a series of emails once you submit your order, to keep you
        updated on its progress, including your tracking number.
        <br />
        <br />
        Of course, during holidays, this demand is more volatile to predict, so
        holidays may cause a delay in production and/or shipping.
        <br />
        <br />
        If your order takes longer than expected, feel free to contact us at
        customerservice@tidesofliberty.com.

        Orders are processed in the order that they are received, except if
        fast-track shipping have been selected for instances like receiving an
        order while it is still in stock to be delivered in time for a birthday
        (in which case, fast-track orders are processed first, followed by
        regular shipping in the order they are received). Orders placed Friday
        after 9pm EST should be expected to begin fulfillment on Monday.
        <br />
        <br />
        Standard business days are Monday through Friday.
